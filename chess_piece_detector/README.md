# Chess Piece Detector

This is a wrapper ROS package for the [yolov5_pytorch_ros](https://github.com/raghavauppuluri13/yolov5_pytorch_ros) package that houses YOLOv5 model weights and launch files to easily run object detection.

The chess piece detection model was trained on [this](https://www.amazon.com/Chess-Armory-Wooden-Interior-Storage/dp/B01256V578/ref=sr_1_29?dchild=1&keywords=chessboard&qid=1625791438&sr=8-29) chessboard, so use that for optimal results.
